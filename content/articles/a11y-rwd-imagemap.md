_This post is based on my lightning talk at [Women Who
Code–NYC](https://www.womenwhocode.com/nyc) end-of-year meetup on December 12,
2018._

&nbsp;

In Fall 2018, my colleague
[Susan Dreher](https://ctl.columbia.edu/about/team/dreher/)
and I worked on the platform migration of a set of web-based learning modules
developed in partnership with Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health.
These modules are offered by the
[Region 2 Public Health Training Center](https://region2phtc.org/)
to the public as continuing education for learners in the public health workforce.

The Public Health Training Center (PHTC) modules were implemented in 2011 in
the CTL’s content management tool
[Pagetree](https://github.com/ccnmtl/django-pagetree). The Pagetree
architecture is based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), a high-level
Python Web framework, backed by a Postgres data store. The design of the sites
was not responsive, and was marginally optimized for accessibility.

We converted the modules into static pages using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), an
open-source static site generator that renders HTML files as output from
content files and layout templates. The goal was not to redesign or re-envision
the original pedagogical objectives of these learning modules, but rather to
move them into an open ecosystem and make some amendments when necessary. These
modules will continue to be offered as free and open educational resources
through the TrainingFinder Real-time Affiliate Integrated Network (TRAIN)
platform.

We saw this migration as an opportunity to redesign and rewrite the codebase to
meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
(WCAG). We also wanted the modules to be compatible with all devices, including
print, especially because they are open to public.

I quickly learned that we couldn’t simply _migrate_ the content over
for responsive web design and accessibility. The content itself (text, images,
table, quizzes, and interactives) _needed to be reworked_.  We needed to make
sure user experience on each device (computer, tablet, smartphone, assistive
technologies, and print) is comparable without compromising the quality of the
content. 

In this post, I’d like to share with you the process that I went through with
one particular piece of content—an imagemap—in one of the module.

{{< figure src="/img/assets/old-phtc.jpg" class="text-center centered bordered responsive" alt="" caption="Image map in the old PHTC module" link="/examples/phtc-imagemap/" >}}

This is an imagemap of an infographic explaining the CDC framework
(__[see it in action](/examples/phtc-imagemap/)__).
This interactive was designed to break the text-heavy sections of a module. As
the cursor hovers on a hotspot, the associated explanation is revealed on the
right. This interaction is not suitable for touchscreen devices. 

The whole interactive was basically image-swapping driven by JavaScript. It was
neither responsive, nor accessible, nor printable. We needed to fix this.

To optimize this interactive infographic for responsive design and
accessibility, I took the following steps: 

1. Be aware of the intended meaning, and how learners learn from this diagram,
2. Unpack and unlearn the assumptions and biases of that design,
3. With the content expert, explore how the information could be repackaged and
delivered differently, and what flexibility could be afforded here,
4. Look at the available framework to form a solution,
5. Repackage the reorganized content,
6. Test the technology, and validate the cognitive process.

## 1. Be aware of the meaning and learning process: Metacognition

To understand what this infographic was for, I needed to figure out what the
intended meaning was, and how learners were expected to learn from this
diagram. What were the assumptions about the visual shapes serving as cues for
this diagram? Why was it designed this way?

{{< figure src="/img/assets/meaning-phtc.jpg" class="text-center centered responsive" alt="" >}}

The arrows in the diagram show directional movement. The positions of the
hotspots signify sequence and order, the hexagonal connectors construct a
cycle, and encompass the shared standards in the middle of the diagram. These
representations are assumed common, based on past uses everywhere for many,
many diagrams.

## 2. Unpack and unlearn

Could the same meaning be presented if the learner didn’t have access to the
visual cues? How could I unpack them?

I knew the following about the diagram:

* The association between one hotspot and the text was one-to-one,
* The hotspots represented steps, the first being the top item, the sequence
was clockwise,
* User could hover the hotspots in order. Or not. There were no “gated”
restrictions in place.

## 3. Repackage content

Imagine these hotspots as beads on a bracelet and string. If I cut that
bracelet and rearrange the hotspots linearly, and place the information text
box below the linear hotspots, the “beads” become headings of tabs. When user
clicks a tab, the associated explanation is revealed in the text box.

{{< figure src="/img/assets/repack-phtc.jpg" class="text-center centered responsive" alt="" >}}

This was an appealing design for the following reasons:

* Clicking the tabs instead of hovering is suited for touchscreen devices,
* Users can navigate the content with their keyboard,
* The tabs are in order (left to right),
* This content can be rearranged, or restacked for small screen sizes,
* There are examples of codes available already for accessible tab content, and
screen readers can “read” it.

Next, I needed to run this new design with the content expert to confirm that
the intended meaning was held up in this arrangement.

## 4. Look at frameworks for solutions

There are many ways to make the new design happen, however, time given was
finite. I chose
[Bootstrap tab nav](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navs/#tabs)
as a solution because it already has the CSS, JavaScript, and accessibility
solutions in place. I wrote a custom CSS to preserve the visual design of the
infographics. I relied heavily on [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/), an open
source rules extension for accessibility to help me debug my code.

## 5. Repackage the reorganized content

This is the __[redesign of the infographic](/examples/phtc-imagemap-redo/)__,
and it looks just like the old one, but with marked improvements:

* It can be read by screen readers,
* The hotspots and associated explanation are now text,
* Users can navigate through the interactive using the tab key, in proper
order,
* The infographic is now responsive, the layout changes accordingly on smaller
screens,
* It is printable.

## 6. Test and validate

I ran this page, and the old version for comparison, against
[Google’s Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), an
open-source tool for performance and accessibility. The accessibility score for
the new version increased from 75% to 93%. It is a little shy of the perfect
score because the color contrast of the diagram didn’t quite meet the WCAG
guidelines. This is still a work in progress.

{{< figure src="/img/assets/lighthouse-phtc.png" class="text-center centered responsive" alt="" >}}

Lighthouse and Axe are accessibility tests for codes and technology. But did
the new arrangement of content make sense cognitively in assistive devices and
on smartphones?

With the content expert, we looked at the redesigned infographic on
smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers to make sure that the content was
delivered as intended by the pedagogy. We ran the page through Apple’s screen
reader, [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/),
to hear if the “reading” was comparable.

We confirmed that the intended meaning of the infographic was preserved on all
devices in the new version.

## Lesson learned

I went through the same process here for other content types in all the
modules—tables, images, charts, and quizzes. The big lesson that I learned from
the PHTC migration project is: Application design for accessibility and
inclusion is not simply a technical implementation appended to a development
process.

In fact, technology is only one piece that made the whole. The other
influencing pieces are pedagogy, the cognitive process, the user-end choices
and control, and the awareness of the comparable experiences of differing
abilities.

{{< figure src="/img/assets/a11y-pieces.png" class="text-center centered responsive" alt="" >}}

The awareness of the learning process informs us how we should code to ensure
that the intended pedagogy can be processed by everyone, with differing
abilities and and comparable experiences, through all devices.
