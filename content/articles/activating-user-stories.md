Projects at the CTL, especially software projects, often start with a discovery
phase that involves envisioning how a tool we’re building will be used. We
write out user stories with great care and effort, outlining particular
features and functionalities. Several of my current projects are in the
discovery phase and others are further along—but the question of how we look
back at and activate written user stories persists. There’s often a swirl of
conversations, notes and proposed features that encircle and sometimes entangle
these user stories, making it difficult to keep track of priorities and
specific tasks along the road to launch. Sometimes talking about what we want
to build and how to build it can lead to a quagmire of discussion that lacks
action. I’ve definitely felt this concern before and I’d like to share a few
tips for activating the user stories we write.

## The Process

As a team, start by thinking through the different types of users that will be
using the software. These can be written as user personas. Typically personas
have distinct components, so it’s helpful to ask a set of questions when
envisioning a persona. What are their goals? What might they hope to gain from
what we’re building? What’s their background (it might be useful to include age
and gender)? What are their behaviors and teaching or learning habits? What are
their pain points—the frustrations this person might have with their current
toolset? And possibly the most important—what are their needs?

Once user personas are in place, it’s time to write user stories. It’s helpful
to keep the format in mind. Follow a template when writing user stories. This
helps standardize the process and makes it easier to extract important
information later on in the development process. Pay attention to the
_acceptance criteria_ section—this doesn’t always have to be written at the
same time as the user story, but it’s very important to define what it means
for the user story to be done or implemented.

After several user stories have been written and the list is growing, it’s
crucial to practice
[user story mapping](https://www.liquidplanner.com/blog/5-reasons-to-use-story-maps-for-your-next-project/).
This means grouping user stories by function and defining the broad categories
they fit into with respect to the software that is being built. It’s important
here to map user stories to specific steps in a documented implementation plan.
Additionally, we should be going a few steps further and breaking each user
story down into discrete tasks.

## Activating the User Stories

The process above outlines a structure for the format and documentation of user
stories. But what about the persistent duty of ensuring our work engages those
user stories? Check out the following tips for user story activation:

* Reference them early and often—the most crucial practice that will help
activate user stories is referring back to them often! 
* Ask the team questions like “how does this fit into our user stories?” or “do
we have a user story for this feature?” 
  * Every feature that gets built and every task that gets assigned should roll
up to a specific user story. 
* New ideas? New user stories!
  * If the conversation within the project has taken a new direction, go back
and revise to make sure any planned changes are addressed by updates to user
story documentation. 
* Steer the discussion and organize notes with user stories in mind.
  * It’s challenging to take a bunch of interesting notes from energizing
brainstorming sessions and come out with specific user stories and features. 
  * After meetings, try to frame the notes in the context of the original set
of user stories.
  * If a new idea doesn’t fit in, write a new user story.  
  Make sure there’s agreement among the team and sufficient time and resources
before adding to the project scope!
* Translate new user stories into Jira epics that break down into specific
tasks that can be accomplished within the development timeline.

## And the Why?

We do this referencing and self-checking on projects so we can avoid redundant
conversation and so we have a record of our decisions and process. Keeping tabs
on user stories and engaging with them actively also helps us ensure we’re
taking cues from our clients and weaving them into what we build, leading to
better client and stakeholder satisfaction.
