The daily systems checklist continues to be a key component of our process here at the CTL. Each morning, a developer verifies system status, reviews application errors and checks for new security alerts. The results are posted on our Slack `sysadmin` channel. The whole thing takes only about 15 minutes or so, maybe a bit longer if new errors require task creation. And, we rotate the task weekly among our team so everyone has a chance to have a birds-eye view.

Still, we always want to save time and context switching. Seeing some of the new Slackbots gave me the idea of recruiting Slack as another checklist participant.
