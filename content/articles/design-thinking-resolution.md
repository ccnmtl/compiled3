Although there seems to be a handful of different methodologies, I feel that
the essence of “design thinking” boils down to three tasks that anyone can—and
must—do first in order to both effectively and empathetically solve design
problems. What are they?

## A Confession

Larry Wall, the creator of the Perl programming language, once said that the
[three great virtues of a programmer](http://threevirtues.com) are laziness,
impatience and hubris. However, these three virtues can sometimes become
disadvantages for me as a non-programmer.
 
I’m an educational product designer and laziness, impatience, and hubris can
sometimes lead me to automatically implement default, shortcut user experience
design strategies and tactics when it comes to wrestling with meeting deadlines
and making clients happy. That’s just part of being human. However,
successfully meeting those short-term goals can sometimes eclipse the long-term
goals of real and messy design problem-solving, which is why design thinking
has become so popular. 

You would think that an educational experience designer at Columbia University
like me would practice design thinking every single day. The truth is that I
don’t (and I should), which is why I will commit to working out my design
thinking muscles even more—my New Year’s resolution for 2020.

## What is Design Thinking?

I used to think that the term “design thinking” was an easy, hyped-up
catchphrase to describe “brainstorming” but it’s so much more than that. In its
most basic sense, design thinking is a pathway to effectively and
empathetically solve design problems.

The bad news with design thinking is that there are different design thinking
methodologies. They all may have different terms for the same concept and
anywhere between three to six distinct design thinking steps. The good news is
that all design thinking methodologies (at least I think so) can be summarized
by these three sequential and essential tasks: __define the problem, generate
ideas to solve it, and test your best idea out by putting it in front of
others.__

__First, define the problem.__ Look at your design problem from every
perspective. Design thinking encourages really looking at it from every angle
imaginable. Go beyond the obvious. Get into the mind of your audience. Ambush
them in a supermarket. Once the look of confusion they give you subsides as you
clutch your clipboard, you’ll get some amazing data and insights about your
problem.

__Then, generate ideas.__ I mean really generate. Go deeper into the problem to
find patterns within it because this is where your audience’s real needs are
hidden. It’s very important to generate as many ideas as you can without
judgement. Suspend that judgement. It’s essential. Don’t think in terms of
“good” or “bad”—just knock them out! Even a whiteboard covered with ideas is
still not enough. You want to see sticky notes both everywhere and anywhere.

__Finally, pick out one of your best ideas and test it out.__ Test out your
concept and fail quickly. Get that feedback ASAP. Pitch your ideas to others
and be sure to generate some excitement with your ideas presentation too. Go
back to that supermarket and show them a cocktail napkin sketch. Produce a
prototype. Perform a skit. Perfection is not a requirement when it comes to
getting buy in. Learn from your testing as quickly as possible—not just to save
time but before security arrives to speak with you as to why you’re performing
sketch comedy at the supermarket.

## Next Steps

Getting familiar with design thinking methodologies is even easier. Read
[a book by Buckminster Fuller](https://www.entreversity.com/comprehensive-anticipatory-design-science/).
Take a day-long design thinking intensive bootcamp at
[The DesignGym](https://www.thedesigngym.com/).
Enroll in a [month-long course at IDEO](https://www.ideou.com/).
If you’re already doing something like this with your own projects then
congratulations—you’re already practicing some form of design thinking. The
design thinking hype is deserved because it works, and anyone can—and
must—practice it when it comes to solving problems. It’s a great tool to
innovate collaboratively with your entire design team as well.

Before you write one line of code or create one pixel, consider design thinking
first. Neither I nor the rest of the world have the time and resources to waste
on software and/or product solutions to problems that we don’t actually have.

Wish me luck. I hope that your 2020 is full of ideas, sticky notes, and
supermarket ambushes too.
