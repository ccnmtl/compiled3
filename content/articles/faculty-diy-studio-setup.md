Study the end credits of just about any film, TV show, or documentary, and
you’ll get a sense of the labor involved in professional media production.
Cameras and microphones must be set up, lights need to be positioned and 
adjusted to illuminate the subject, and the content has to be captured in an
aesthetically pleasing way all while maintaining an aggressive production
schedule. This requires planning, technical skills, and many hours of dedicated
work time.

But what if these preparatory steps were turnkey? A single set up with cameras,
microphones, and lights positioned and ready for “Action”? What if this level
of production was readily available to instructors for creating course content
without the need for a full production team? This was the impetus behind the
design of the CTL DIY studios. The two CTL studio spaces, located in separate
campus locations, offer instructors professional-level recordings without all
of the steps necessary to plan, build, and operate the equipment. Accomplishing
this takes forethought and much consideration. So, what does it take to put a
DIY studio together? This post proposes four things to keep in mind when
considering a DIY Recording Studio for instructional content.

## 1. Simplify the set-up

Production is a very demanding process. HD and even 4K cameras in modern
consumer laptop and mobile devices make it deceivingly easy to capture
acceptable results. But for a truly professional look, a more elaborate setup
is required. Our DIY studios use a traditional three-point lighting design with
LED production lights to enhance the subject and create a three dimensional
appearance in a two dimensional medium. The lights feature manual adjustments
for color temperature and light intensity, which can evoke a different mood or
atmosphere if needed.

The studios also include neutral tone backdrops that create a studio aesthetic
and draw viewers’ attention to the on-camera subject. For audio, we mounted a
broadcast quality microphone on a stand with an adjustable pickup pattern,
which works great for podcasts. An optional high fidelity lapel microphone
(known as a lavalier or “lav” mic) provides a more dynamic sound quality, but
may require assistance setting up. The Butler 204 Studio is equipped with a 4K
PTZ camera with pan, tilt, zoom, and focus functions easily adjusted with a
remote. The CUIMC Studio offers a 4K camera that is adjusted manually without a
remote. Both DIY recording studios eliminate the commitment in time and
resources by having all of this gear positioned and ready to go once powered
on, rather than built out by our media team each time a recording is scheduled.

## 2. Make it user friendly

Even with prep work eliminated, operating the gear can be intimidating for some
users unfamiliar with production. Aim to alleviate the anxiety some might feel
by reducing the steps necessary to power on the equipment and record their
content. We minimized the controls and distilled the process down to two
buttons in the Butler 204 Studio: one button to power up the computer, and one
button for the power strip which switches on the media capture equipment. From
there on it’s a simple matter of checking that the camera and microphone are
selected as the video and audio source in the recording program, making sure
the camera is framed correctly with the remote control, and pressing record.

## 3. Support with documentation

Even if a user is confident with AV technology, referring to a list of
recording best practices can be helpful. We posted on the studio wall a
laminated best practices guide with easy to follow numbered steps for setup.
These documents are also available on the CTL website.  Equally important are
learning design best practices for creating purposeful and engaging
instructional content. The media team designed an instructor reservation form
with feedback from learning designers to make sure they are integral to the
“intake” process.

## 4. Streamline the process

Ultimately the idea behind the DIY Studios is to allow instructors with any
level of skill or technical expertise to record high quality media with ease
and convenience. Streamlining the reservation/pre-production process, along
with simplified equipment controls, goes a long way to make things happen
smoothly.

[A reservation form in the style of a checklist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfab79iufK_MCO7lg-6jfMBADMpDz9RIbCMbiUuvGkootKZmw/viewform)
greatly improves our internal fielding process by removing back-and-forth
communication. When a user submits a request, the reservation generates an
automatic notification to the media team, who in turn can make themselves
available to support if needed and grant access to the space for the
instructor. The media team will then coordinate with a learning designer to
ensure effective and purposeful content creation for students and courses.

To further improve efficiency, we’re developing an integration with our
ticketing system which will automatically generate a ticket for learning
designers once a request for the studio has been submitted. This way both the
media and learning design teams will instantly be notified negating lengthy
email exchanges to provide recording details.

Improvement of our DIY recording studios is an ongoing process based on
feedback from our users. It is the hope of the media team that as the studios
evolve to continually provide a better user experience, they will continue to
attract a greater number of instructors to produce media for their courses.
