In late February, I attended a Google interactive workshop, hosted by the [Emerging Technology Consortium](https://confluence.columbia.edu/confluence/display/ETC/) of CUIT. Google showcased a few of their products that could potentially be used by staff, faculty, and students of Columbia in teaching and learning.

Some of the products they showcased include:

## Jamboard
[Jamboard](https://gsuite.google.com/products/jamboard/) is an interactive whiteboard developed by Google, as part of the G Suite family. It has a 55" 4k touchscreen display, and has compatibility for online collaboration through cross-platform support. The display can also be mounted onto a wall or be configured into a stand.

## Google Expeditions AR
The [Expeditions AR](https://edu.google.com/expeditions/ar/) mode harnesses Google’s Tango Augmented Reality (AR) Platform, which uses Visual Positioning Service (VPS) technology to map indoor locations. With a Tango-compatible device, the camera utilizes VPS to recognize specific objects and landmarks. We had the opportunity to see immersive 3D models of bacteria, viruses and dinosaurs.

## Google Daydream
[Daydream](https://vr.google.com/daydream/) is Google’s mobile virtual reality (VR) platform, that is built into the Android operating system. These Daydream-ready phones are coupled with [Daydream View](https://vr.google.com/daydream/smartphonevr/) VR headset for an immersive VR experience. In the demonstration session, we were “placed” in a classroom as a student who was experiencing an anxiety attack before an exam.

## Tour Builder
[Tour Builder](https://tourbuilder.withgoogle.com), which is still in beta, is a new way to show the places you’ve visited and the experiences you had along the way using Google Earth. It lets you pick the locations right on the map, add in photos, text and video, and then share your creation. We had the opportunity to visit the site of Civil War reenactments in Antietam.
