The Grace Hopper Celebration is a yearly event to highlight the contributions
of women to computing. [Grace Hopper](https://president.yale.edu/biography-grace-murray-hopper)
was an American computer scientist, mathematician and naval officer.
Among her many achievements, she is recognized for her work in designing
and implementing programming languages, and her drive to create an
English-language compiler.

In lieu of jumping on a plane to Houston this year, I instead
attended the first 
[Grace Hopper Connect @ Google event in NYC](https://ghcconnectnyc.splashthat.com/).

The day was a great opportunity to be inspired by technology leaders,
meet developers in my community and take a moment to reflect on my own
experiences as a woman in technology.

Here are a few impressions, phrases and inspiration that resonated
through the day as we watched the GHC keynote speakers, heard from local
NYC women in technology and discussed our personal experiences.


## Keynote Inspiration

### Ben Fried, VP &amp; CIO, Google
Fried, a native New Yorker, opened the session with the recognition
that NYC’s diversity and richness is not reflected
within Google’s walls. His pledge to support future diversity efforts at
Google was welcome and felt sincere. Though, I still cringe over the
[“Manifesto”](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320),
and note Google’s [dismal diversity stats](https://www.wired.com/story/googles-employee-diversity-numbers-havent-really-improved/).

### Padmasree Warrior, CEO &amp; Chief Development Officer, NIO U.S.

Ms. Warrior reflected on her own career and offered tips on career mobility.
The tip that resonated with me and drove directly to the insecurity and
self-doubt that often plagues women in the sciences:

“Open doors &amp; go through them. Don’t wait for the perfect door.”

### Dr. Rebecca Parsons, CTO Thoughtworks
[Bio](https://anitab.org/profiles/abie-award-winners/technical-leadership/rebecca-parsons/) | [Video](https://youtu.be/o7QO0VRTDUE?t=2527)

Dr. Parsons is the winner of this year’s “Technical Leadership Abie Award”,
and has long been an advocate for women in the tech fields. In her acceptance
speech, she spoke about finding yourself.

“What are the words that define you, who you really aspire to be.
Find those words, then live them and share them.”

### Jennifer O. Matthews, Uncharted Power
[Bio](https://ghc.anitab.org/2018-speakers-honorees/2018-speakers/jessica-o-matthews/) | [Video](https://youtu.be/o7QO0VRTDUE?t=3491)
Ms. Matthews is the Founder &amp; CEO of Uncharted Power, an award-winning
renewable power company right here in NYC. The company was founded by Jessica
when she was only 22 years old.

Ms. Matthews spoke about being authentic. Revealing to others how
we landed in our positions, revealing where we came from and what worked for
us.

“Being underestimated is the best thing that every happened to me.
I’m coming for you Elon Musk!”

## NYC Leaders
And a few sound bytes from our NYC speakers:

* Kelechi Anyadiegwu, Founder &amp; CEO, Zuvaa
   * Fuck those guys (that stand in your way).
* Lydia Chilton, Computer Science Professor, Columbia University
   * Always have an ally.
* Demma Rodriguez, Head of Equity Engineering, Google
   * When you walk into a room, draw on our ancestors strength.
* Kara Levy, Engineering Manager, Google
   * Do what you love!

## A Funny Moment
I think the funniest moment, for me, was encountering the long line at the
restroom. Usually at tech events, I sail right into the women’s room, all
the while laughing at the long men’s room lines. For me, that moment has
always been a positive but marked note of my own difference. From now on,
I’m hoping to encounter longer and longer women’s room lines at every
tech event I attend.
