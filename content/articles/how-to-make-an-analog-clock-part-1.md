Over the past few months that I've been working with graphical
programming, it's been fun to get insight into how the real world
works, i.e., how things are visually laid out and move
around. Sometimes it reminds me of a book I liked reading when I was
younger, [The Way Things Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_Things_Work). The book is all illustrations, so you
don't actually read it so much as pore over the details in all its
drawings.

This post goes over how to program an analog-style clock like this
one, with draggable minute and hour hands.

The clock I'm making is actually a 24-hour clock, not a 12-hour clock,
but all the movement is the same.

First of all, separate out what moves in this scene from what always
stays the same. There are really three different things to think about
here: the clock face, the minute hand, and the hour hand. If you don't
already have some image to use as the clock face, search for one
online or make one in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) (There's really no reason to use
Adobe's stuff if you don't have to).

Here's the clock face I'm using:

{{< figure
    caption="A clock face" src="/img/assets/clockface.png"
    alt="A clock face" >}}

Also, I'm using Pixi instead of Canvas for two reasons: I need to
treat the clock hands like objects (rotating them independently of
each other), and also I want to respond to mouse movements and
dragging behavior.

In the code, the first thing to do is make the clock's DOM container
element and put the clock face in it. Once the DOM is ready to be
interacted with (i.e., in the componentDidMount() callback if you're
using React), create the PIXI.Application, load the clock face image,
and start the initial drawing procedure.

```
componentDidMount() {
    const me = this;

    const timePickerApp = new PIXI.Application({
        backgroundColor: 0xffffff,
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
        sharedLoader: true,
        sharedTicker: true,
        forceCanvas: true
    });
    this.timePickerApp = timePickerApp;
    this.timePicker.appendChild(timePickerApp.view);

    this.loader.load((loader, resources) => {
        me.resources = resources;

        me.drawClockScene(timePickerApp, resources.clock);
    });
}
```

Now let's make the hands of the clock. Here are some relevant parts of
a function called from componentDidMount(). Don't be intimidated by
all the rigmarole here... I know it looks awkward but it all comes
from trial and error, building things up from the basics. For example,
through putting this together I found that I need to use a
PIXI.Container, even though it only contains one object, just because
of a quirk with Pixi that makes Containers easier to rotate.

```
drawClockScene(app, resource) {
    const center = new PIXI.Point(
        app.view.width / 2, app.view.height / 2);

    // Draw the minute hand
    // Put it in a PIXI.Container so it's easier to rotate.
    const minuteContainer = new PIXI.Container();
    minuteContainer.interactive = true;
    minuteContainer.buttonMode = true;
    const minuteHand = new PIXI.Graphics()
                             .beginFill(0x666666)
                             .drawRoundedRect(
                                 0, 0,
                                 4, bg.height / 2.3,
                                 4);
    minuteContainer.addChild(minuteHand);
    minuteContainer.position.set(this.center.x, this.center.y);
    minuteContainer.pivot = new PIXI.Point(2, 5);
    minuteContainer.rotation = Math.PI;
    app.stage.addChild(minuteContainer);
    this.minuteHand = minuteContainer;
}
```

The code for drawing the hour hand is pretty much the same, so I'm not
going to include it here. There's a link to the full source code at
the end.

When you start programming any sort of circular motion like this, you
quickly learn the significance of [Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi), and how to work with it along
with the related [Sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine) and [Cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine) functions.

You can represent angles in degrees or radians. Sometimes it's
actually more convenient to work with radians instead of degrees, it
doesn't really matter - I switch between these unit types all the time
in the code. Just remember that:

A full circle == Pi * 2 radians == 360 degrees

So how would you display the minute hand at the correct rotation?
There are 60 minutes in an hour, which the minute hand displays as a
full circle. So you can treat each minute as one sixtieth of Pi * 2.

Here in React code, when the time state changes, the minute and hour
hands are updated to reflect that state. getMinutes() returns the
current time's minute (0 to 59), and the angle of a single minute can
be written as one sixtieth of Pi * 2. There's also an offset of -Pi at
the end of the equation, just because of a particularity in where the
minute hand's initial position is.

The hour hand moves in a similar way. You can replace the 24 below with
12 for a 12-hour clock.

```
componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    if (prevProps.dateTime !== this.props.dateTime) {
        // Update the clock.
        const minutes = this.props.dateTime.getMinutes();
        this.minuteHand.rotation = (minutes / 60) * (Math.PI * 2)
                                 - Math.PI;

        const hours = this.props.dateTime.getHours();
        this.hourHand.rotation = ((hours + (minutes / 60)) / 24) * (
            Math.PI * 2) - Math.PI;
    }
}
```

Making these clock hands draggable by the user is a whole new
challenge. I'll go over that in a separate post because there's a lot
more to it, and required a lot more learning on my part.

In the mean time, you can see the final result of this clock in the
[Motions of the Sun Simulator](https://ccnmtl.github.io/astro-simulations/sun-motion-simulator/), and the source code is here:
[Clock.jsx](https://github.com/ccnmtl/astro-simulations/blob/master/sun-motion-simulator/src/Clock.jsx). Again, there's a lot of idiosyncratic code involved to make
all the fine-tunings correct. But I hope this is helpful for anyone
else making a graphical analog clock, or just as a re-usable React
component.
