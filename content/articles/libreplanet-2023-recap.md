I want to summarize the
[LibrePlanet 2023](https://libreplanet.org/2023/)
conference and also share some thoughts on how the ideas of the free software
movement relate to ed-tech in higher education.  LibrePlanet is the
[Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/)’s annual March conference
in Boston.

As the conference began,
[I presented](https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/3demos-a-collaborative-visual-calculus-system/ "3Demos: A collaborative visual calculus system")
on a recent project, [3Demos](https://3demos.ctl.columbia.edu/). In this
project, the CTL partnered with Drew Youngren, Columbia Univeristy Lecturer in
the Discipline of Applied Mathematics, to create a collaborative
tool for illustrating multi-variable calculus concepts.

Educator and researcher Erin Rose Glass gave a keynote talk titled
“[Education and the future of software freedom](https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/education-and-the-future-of-software-freedom/)”.
She presented the current world of ed-tech, whether it’s a learning
management system or a plagiarism detection tool, as a vast, opaque
surveillance apparatus. These technologies are unfortunately standard
in the world of higher education, and students aren’t always given
much choice on how they interact with these tools.

In contrast, Glass also touched on her experience with efforts like
the [CUNY Academic Commons](https://commons.gc.cuny.edu/), that show
the fun, creative side of educational technology. As Glass noted, and
I mentioned in my talk, there are endless possibilities for digital
technology in education. We can think wider than just what the ed-tech
industry provides: through close partnership with faculty and
institutions, we’re able to create things that aren’t possible
elsewhere. Just think: what new possibilities haven’t been uncovered
yet?

You can read Erin Rose Glass’s blog post tying the topics of her
keynote to other ethical dilemmas in software supply chain security:
[Dystopian edtech and the future of software supply chain security](https://www.erinroseglass.com/dystopian-edtech-and-the-future-of-software-supply-chain-security/)

The CTL also worked with Thomas Groll, Senior Lecturer in the Discipline of
International and Public Affairs, to develop
[EconPractice](https://econpractice.ctl.columbia.edu/about/). EconPractice is
an example of how free/open source software provides value and
flexibility for a learning tool. Early iterations of these interactive
economics graphs were built out using proprietary tools provided by a
large ed-tech company called Smart Sparrow. While these tools made it
possible to put the initial stages of this project together, its
technical functionality had hard limits that couldn’t be overcome by
Smart Sparrow’s development model.  It also required significant
licensing costs on the part of both instructor and student in order to
access this technology.

Through our partnership with Groll, we’ve put together custom graphs
using another open source project
[JSXGraph](https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/).  Our use of JSXGraph
led us to participate in the [JSXGraph
conference](https://jsxgraph.org/conf2022/) last fall, through which
we’ve made new connections with the wider community of economists and
technologists using tools like this to teach in the classroom. None of
this would’ve been possible if EconPractice was still built on top of
Smart Sparrow.

Of course, custom-built, bespoke and sustainable free software isn’t
always viable.  The CTL is fortunate to have the resources to build
and maintain our projects for years. Although only a small percentage
of prospective projects get approved for funding, our vast
[portfolio](https://portfolio.ctl.columbia.edu/)
grows steadily.  In addition to the significant effort it takes to put
together a project like this, any software needs development expertise
to keep it working as platform technology changes over time.

When you don’t have the resources and expertise of a CTL to support
the development of an idea, a service like Smart Sparrow can make a
lot of sense. I suppose it’s my hope that ed-tech companies are able
to embrace the open nature of the web so that their technology remains
accessible to the widest range of people. Moreover, they must think
larger than themselves, and consider how their technology can remain
useful in situations where their company changes, or is no longer
around.

We have also seen that a framework like [H5P](https://h5p.org/) can
be a more reliable alternative to easily create the sort of
interactivity that something like Smart Sparrow provides, without
requiring real development work.

As we design technology for classroom use, it’s important to look
deeply at the technology involved at all its various layers. For
example, why do we even have this thing called "the web" that we make
learning tools with?
The nature of academia lends itself easily to the hands-on, open
principles of free software. Indeed,
[hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture)
prides itself on fostering the natural collaboration that occurs in
the practice of teaching and learning.

Similarly, from a student’s perspective, what tools will I use to take
me through my academic career, and how can I ensure that I will always
have access to the digital artifacts I create, as technology changes
under our feet? Columbia faculty
Dennis Tenen delves deeper into these questions in his book,
[Plain Text: The Poetics of Computation](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=26821).

Here are a few more highlights I’ve noted from the conference. As LibrePlanet
always has multiple talks going on at once, I unfortunately wasn’t
able to capture everything.

* An Australian hacker who calls himself [Sick Codes](https://sick.codes/) spoke about
[The state of free software in farming, food agriculture](https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/the-state-of-free-software-in-farming-food-agriculture/).
Specifically, he exposed the dilemmas confronted by farmers who own
John Deere tractors, and their now-precarious right to repair and
manage their investments, and in many cases their livelihood.
* Dr. William Cooper Davidon, an engineer at the Federal Aviation
Administration, spoke about software safety in airlines and their
surrounding federal regulations.
[Safety-critical software certification and why free software](https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/safety-critical-software-certification-and-why-free-software/)

The conference concluded with an inspiring keynote from Dr. Elizabeth
Chamberlain from iFixit on
[the future of the right to repair and free software](https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/the-future-of-the-right-to-repair-and-free-software/).
