__M.O.O.C__ stands for Massive Open Online Course.

The name is no exaggeration. These open online courses are MASSIVE!

In this CompilED article, I’ve outlined __3 key takeaways__ from what I’ve
learned in helping to coordinate large-scale video projects at Columbia
University’s Center for Teaching and Learning.

__Takeaway 1:__ Set the scope early in the process.  
__Takeaway 2:__ Collaborate consistently throughout the project.  
__Takeaway 3:__ Leverage Essential Graphics in Adobe After Effects.  

## Before we jump in

The takeaways in this article are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to
developing and producing a MOOC. The advice below is more geared towards
communication and graphics. However, I’d like to take a moment here to stress
the critical role that documentation plays in reducing cognitive load.
Internally at the CTL, we developed a comprehensive MOOC Handbook with over 16
pages of recommended practices, technical instructions, checklists, and relevant
links to other documentation generated over the years. The MOOC Handbook is a
constant work in progress, with all members of the Media Team encouraged to
discuss and amend the documentation based on new strategies and techniques.

## Takeaway 1: Set the scope early in the process

### The first step is setting expectations

Due to the grant-funded nature of our work, we often collaborate with various
clients (faculty, instructors, and graduate students) who all have different
priorities, schedules, and ideas. When I first came to the CTL back in 2018,
something I saw happening often was that, when it came to the client, CTL staff
had a hard time saying “No.” And that’s understandable, as the CTL wants to
deliver exceptional service when it comes to enhancing and designing courses at
one of the world’s most renowned universities.

However, being unable to say “no” leads to any worker’s worst nightmare, __scope
creep__. Scope creep refers to how a project’s requirements tend to increase
over a project’s life cycle. Many CTL staff members, especially on the Media
Team, were feeling the effects of scope creep sink its claws into our projects.

The dreaded scope creep was due to several factors. However, the main one we
identified is that project goals were not comprehensively defined from the
start.

Over the past few grant cycles, the CTL has been able to limit scope creep and
streamline production in a variety of ways. What has made the largest impact, to
me, is the __modification of the grant application and acceptance process__ for
projects that include software development and media production. Leadership took
verbal feedback from staff and added both the associate directors for Software
Development and Media Production to the RFP review and selection process. They
also added much more information to the grant application that set clear
expectations for our clients, should their grant be selected. Additionally,
after a project is selected, prior to any development or media work commencing,
the project team reviews a __Preparation Agreement__ with the recipient of the
grant to set expectations. The project team then collaborates on writing a
__Scope of Work__ document, which is signed by the client. Since these measures
have been put in place, the CTL project teams and our faculty partners have a
much clearer understanding of the project scope early on, helping to set the
project off on the right foot and keep it on track throughout its lifecycle.

## Takeaway 2: Collaborate consistently throughout the project

### Schedule a series of meetings

Collaboration with an external client can always be tricky, but what’s most
important is that internally the core team members are on the same page. For
large projects and MOOCs, we find that the most effective teams comprise the
following roles:

1. Project Manager (PM)
2. Learning Designer (LD)
3. Media Lead (ML)
4. Media Team members available to fill in for various roles, such as
cinematographer, editor, animator, and graphic designer 
5. Developer (if applicable)
6. Designer
7. Assessment and evaluation

While it’s important to cut down on unnecessary meetings whenever possible,
we’ve found it ideal to plan for an array of meetings that help to support the
work.

These meetings include:

1. Preparation Agreement signing: The PM meets with the client to go over and
sign the estimation of work document that was described in Takeaway 1.
2. Internal kickoff: PM, LD, and ML meet to discuss the project’s grant
proposal.
3. Client kickoff: PM, LD, ML, client (and TAs if applicable) meet to introduce
themselves and define their roles, set up the client on Slack, and schedule a
bi-weekly project meeting with the client.
4. Client biweekly: PM, LD, ML, and the client meet once every two weeks
throughout the length of the MOOC project in order to stay on track.
5. Internal biweekly: PM, LD, and ML meet prior to the bi-weekly client meetings
to discuss and resolve internal issues and tasks. These meetings can also serve
as a great time to brainstorm ideas to pitch to the client.

See, that’s not too bad. However, what good are all these meetings if there
isn’t a proper note-taking strategy involved? A note-taking strategy is
essential to communicate roles, responsibilities, and timelines throughout the
length of the project. Luckily, we’ve implemented a system that has worked well
for us in several projects.

### Create meeting notes documents

At the start of the project, we create two “Meeting Notes” documents within the
project’s Shared Drive on Google, one that is client-facing and one that is
internal. The structure is simple and flexible: use Semantics within Google
Drive (Heading 1) to list the date and then take notes within the date of the
meeting.

{{<figure

People are still welcome to take their own notes, but the Meeting Notes document
is a reliable place for managing tasks, listing questions that need to be
answered, and linking to relevant sources. For a project like a MOOC, which can
span over a year, these collaborative meeting notes quickly become a lifeline
because they represent the mental model shared by the team. The notes are
extremely easy to navigate and remind those working on the project of remaining
tasks and decisions that were made months prior. Since implementing this
process, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard the phrase, “Let’s check the
meeting notes!”

### Set up a Slack channel for the project

Another effective means of communication that we use at the CTL is Slack, a
digital communication platform where all members of our organization have
access. This application is extremely useful for cutting down on emails while
simultaneously opening up and encouraging channels of communication. In fact,
there are so many useful features for project management within Slack that it
most likely deserves its own Compiled article. However, I will do my best to
cover some of the bases here.

Not only is Slack good for ephemeral communication, but it is also great for
recall, as the chat threads generated are searchable. I’d like to highlight that
we have the capability to invite people from outside of our organization to
collaborate with us on Slack. We had great success with this in
[Menstruation in a Global Context: Addressing Policy and Practice](https://www.edx.org/course/menstruation-in-a-global-context-addressing-policy-and-practice).
Our Project Manager invited our clients onto Slack, where
they had the ability to communicate with us through the designated channel,
`#mooc-menstruation`, or with us individually through direct messaging. This
facilitated much more open communication between the CTL team and the client and
allowed us to resolve issues and complete tasks in a timely manner.

We recognize that it can be overwhelming sometimes to be asked to learn a new
application or tool. Therefore, it is necessary to stress to the client how much
Slack will improve their experience throughout the length of the project. The
introduction and explanation of this tool’s intended use should be scaffolded
into the first meetings held with the client, so they have a solid understanding
of its purpose and usefulness when it comes to communicating with us.

## Takeaway 3: Leverage Essential Graphics in Adobe After Effects

Like Slack, this last takeaway probably deserves its own Compiled article.
However, I wanted to touch on it here because when it comes to producing
repetitive graphics for large quantities of videos, there has been no greater
innovation than Adobe’s Essential Graphics. Essential Graphics is a feature
found in both Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere. These two programs already
facilitate the creation of moving graphics and images. What Essential Graphics
allows you to do is templatize the designs you create so that they are easily
applied and editable within your Adobe Premiere timeline.

Before Essential Graphics, the process for generating graphics for our videos
was much more involved. Additionally, should changes need to be made, the
process of replacing graphics was equally time-consuming. However, with
Essential Graphics, the templates we generated are editable directly within
Premiere, so edits and changes can be made almost instantly.

In the summer of 2020, a group of us worked together to develop a set of __MOOC
Branding Graphics__, identifying the most common graphics that appear in our
online courses so that we could standardize them into editable templates (called
`.MOGRT` files) using Adobe After Effects’ Essential Graphics feature.

After several months of discussion surrounding design and a series of rigorous
tests, we developed a __Spec Deck for MOOC Essential Graphics__ that we were
able to leverage for our MOOC,
[Menstruation in a Global Context: Addressing Policy and Practice](https://www.edx.org/course/menstruation-in-a-global-context-addressing-policy-and-practice).
This MOOC has over 40 videos, many of them around 15
minutes long. Once we had our Essential Graphics though, completing the project
was infinitely more manageable, allowing us to make edits on the fly within
Adobe Premiere.

While it might seem like a high barrier to entry, if you know how to do simple
graphics within After Effects, you can teach yourself how to do Essential
Graphics by watching video tutorials online. There are links to some useful ones
below. I encourage all video editors to familiarize themselves with how to make
simple Essential Graphics in After Effects and how to use them within Premiere
for future projects.

## Conclusion

I hope these key takeaways have provided you with some useful strategies and
examples that you can draw upon when doing your own video production for MOOCs.
While MOOCs have been around for a while now, they are still evolving, as is all
of higher education and online courses.
[Research indicates that](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattsymonds/2019/12/07/moocs-make-way-for-spocs-in-the-global-education-of-tomorrow/?sh=769a7a1943da)
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCS) are not as effective for learning as Small Private Online
Courses (SPOCS). This is not surprising to me, as in real life, much research
indicates that having smaller class sizes helps facilitate learning. MOOCs still
have an important role to fill, particularly in an ever evolving global pandemic
that has catalyzed the demand for more online learning resources.

By utilizing the three takeaways listed above, you will not only improve your
chance for success, but you will be allowing yourself the space and supportive
structure to thrive. The CTL plans to build upon these strategies as we push the
boundaries of in-person and online courses, all with the goal of maximizing
learning in the online space.
