_Mapping visualizations have been a core component of many of our custom
digital learning applications. The geographical interactivity has promoted a
significantly richer experience, deepening understanding and encouraging
exploration and discovery. My understanding of how to build these applications
has improved through collaboration with our clients, the talented
faculty and students who form the basis of our audience._

## Where to start?
The primary stack that underpins these applications is:
[Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
paired with
[GeoDjango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/gis/tutorial/)
and the 
[PostGis spatial backend](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/gis/install/postgis/).
All are well-documented and well-supported. Google Map alternatives include
[Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.007/-95.844) and
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).

## Geo-who-what?
Our partners generally want to show *something* on the map: a location in a
forest, a site of teaching and learning, a place where a book was printed. I
first walk them through the mechanics of
[geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding) and
[reverse geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_geocoding).

Geocoding uses address components to retrieve the latitude and longitude of a
location. Reverse geocoding or address lookup provides a description of a given
latitude and longitude.

For example:  
`116th St & Broadway, New York, NY 10027, United States` geocodes to `40.8075° N, 73.9626° W`.  
`40.8075° N, 73.9626° W` reverse geocodes to 
`116th St & Broadway, New York, NY 10027, United States`

## What’s the location?
Obtaining geocodes through geocoding a _modern_ set of _well-formed_ addresses
is usually straightforward. A batch process can call the Google API for each
address then stash the results.
[Call the API slowly if you don’t want to incur charges...](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/usage-and-billing)

Problems can arise in a few situations. The
[Virtual Forest Initiative](https://blackrock.ccnmtl.columbia.edu)
supports research and
education at [Black Rock Forest](https://blackrockforest.org). Scientists
wanted to visually locate experiments and studies that took place in remote
areas without well-formed addresses. Reverse geocoding wasn’t possible here.
Instead, locations were geocoded through an admin interface. Editors dropped
pins on a map to specify a latitude and longitude. Luckily, the data set was
fairly small making this solution workable.

[Footprints](https://footprints.ccnmtl.columbia.edu) is an application that
traces the path of physical book copies through time and space for the
[early modern period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period),
roughly between 1500 and 1800. We obviously couldn’t rely on a geocoding
service due to historical location descriptions. Initially, we’ve relied on
a manual process to geocode the locations. We were then able to optimize this
process by drawing in geocoded data from our existing data set.

## What’s the address?
We use reverse geocoding, a.k.a. address lookup, in our applications to allow
users to specify an address by dropping a pin on a map.
_[Writ Large NYC](https://writlarge.ccnmtl.columbia.edu)_ is an application that locates
sites of teaching and learning in neighborhoods around New York City. An editor
drops a pin at a given location, which then automatically kicks off a reverse geocode
operation.

{{< figure src="/img/assets/writlargelocation.png"
    class="bordered"
    alt="This is a screenshot of the location selection interface at the Writ Large NYC website." >}}

The reverse geocoding operation returns an array of addresses, with a
[type field](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding#GeocodingAddressTypes)
indicating the precision. Precision ranges from `street_address` to `country`. An
individual address result is an array of components,
again with a [type field](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding#GeocodingAddressTypes)
describing the component.

Here’s an example of a reverse geocode result for our office at Lewisohn Hall
at Columbia University. This is the list of addresses, highlighting the
third address of *street_address* type.

```
Array(11)
1: ...
2: ...
3:
    types: ["street_address"]
    formatted_address: "2976 Broadway, New York, NY 10027, USA"
    address_components: Array[8]
        0:
            long_name: "2976"
            short_name: "2976"
            types: ["street_number"]
        1: {long_name: "Broadway", short_name: "Broadway", ...}
        2: {long_name: "Manhattan", short_name: "Manhattan", ...}
        3:
            long_name: "New York"
            short_name: "New York"
            types: (2) ["locality", "political"]
        4: {long_name: "New York County", short_name: "New York County", ...}
        5: {long_name: "New York", short_name: "NY", ...}
        6: {long_name: "United States", short_name: "US", ...}
        7: {long_name: "10027", short_name: "10027", types: ...}
...
```

Usually the results make sense, but look out
for inconsistencies as you pick and choose your address components. In
_[Writ Large NYC](https://writlarge.ccnmtl.columbia.edu)_, I simply use the
`street address` result type directly. For [Footprints](https://footprints.ccnmtl.columbia.edu),
determining the components that equal city and country took a little
work. I ended up pulling out the `locality` and `country` components
from the `street address` type for display. My first choice, the
`locality` type did not always exist. But, this can get a little wonky
too. If you drop a pin near Oxford, England, you might end up with England,
United Kingdom. I should probably revisit that behavior.

## Display and Interaction
Once the *things* you want to display are geocoded, the fun begins. Here’s a
quick look at each of the display and feature choices we made for our most
recent mapping applications.

----------------
### [Virtual Forest Initiative](https://blackrock.ccnmtl.columbia.edu)
* Satellite.
* Clickable icons with popup info windows.
* KML overlays with points of interest.
* “Search Nearby” feature that takes advantage of the
[GeoDjango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/gis/tutorial/)
backend
[distance lookups](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/gis/db-api/#distance-lookups).

----------------
### [Footprints](https://footprints.ccnmtl.columbia.edu) ([GitHubrepo](https://github.com/ccnmtl/footprints/))
* Roadmap.
* Clickable icons with popup info windows.
* [Overlapping Marker Spiderfier](https://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier) to handle
situations where many data points where at the same latitude and longitude. 

{{< figure src="/img/assets/footprintsmap.png"
    class="bordered"
    alt="This is a screenshot of the Footprints interactive map." >}}

----------------
### _[Writ Large NYC](https://writlarge.ccnmtl.columbia.edu)_ 
* Styled map using [Snazzy Maps](https://snazzymaps.com/style/151/ultra-light-with-labels).
* Map overlays from [New York Public Library’s Map Warper tool](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/).
* Clickable icons with overlay info windows.
* Custom icons.

## Big Ideas
We are continuing to iterate on our mapping applications and have some big ideas
on where to go next. One big idea that we haven’t realized yet for both
Footprints and _Writ Large NYC_ is the ability to “play” our locations
over time. It is something like what [TimeMapper](http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/)
does but with a greater focus on the map rather than the accompanying details.
