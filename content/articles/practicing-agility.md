  [Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

The CTL development team has committed to refining our processes this
year. Our goal is to craft a more efficient, repeatable design and development
approach that adheres to
[agile values and principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), and
also boosts collaboration and transparency.

The Center has long thought deeply about how we do our work. We were guided
first by the [Design Research methodology](http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/dr/about/),
which married “digital technologies with pedagogical theory and practice.” This
iterative methodology ensured new projects aligned with our teaching and
learning mission, but lacked detail on how the design and development
work were completed. We borrowed elements from
[Gov.UK’s Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
to fill in those gaps.
But even then, we’ve still felt the need for a clearer implementation path.

Our Associate Director [Shashi Yellambhatla](/authors/yellambhatla/) started us
with the Scrum methodology early last year. We warmed up with regular stand-up
meetings and two-week sprints. Daily standups started in the summer, along with
a sprint review meeting. The Scrum introduction coincided with a tooling shift
to Jira.

This fall, we were ready to reflect and consider how to deepen our practice.
We decided to engage in short readings and discussions on agile in general, and
Scrum in particular. During these discussions, we all agreed that the
principles expressed in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
reflect our core values. The stand-up meetings were mostly okay, and the sprint
review meetings gave us a chance to demonstrate our work. But, we also pointed
out rough spots...

* Our team is small, and we are each working on at least two
projects at a time. Scrum is organized around individual project teams.
How do we tune this methodology so we can plan and prioritize work
across projects?

* Planning was still taking place at the individual level. Our multiple project
backlogs were united...but each project team was entering tasks in different
ways...or not at all. What was the “right” way to go from user stories to tasks?
How could we integrate the project teams into this planning step?

* Jira still felt awkward. We weren’t sure how to use epics, tasks, subtasks,
components and other organization elements to reflect our work. We all expressed
frustration with the interface, and the inability to see a solid view of our
work in progress.

What to do? Inspired by this [training video from Don McGreal](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syXnhduPxqM), we decided to take a break from
Jira, and paper-prototype our planning and task creation process.

Our project manager Meesha Meksin and I took the the job of collecting a set of
user stories to prepare a sprint, and handwriting those stories on Post-it
notes. In the first unified planning meeting, team members grabbed their user
stories and wrote out their tasks. That first planning session went well,
and took less time than the old meetings.

A few quick reflections:

* The process of backlog grooming and curating a set of user stories for a
sprint actually doesn’t take that long. A few hours at the most. I was
holding back on doing this as I felt that _all_ the project backlogs needed
a _perfect_ set of user stories. We actually only need a few
good stories that encompass the prioritized work for the upcoming sprint.

* The unified planning meeting organically created a space for team
members to chat about how work would get done.

* We need to more clearly define what a “user story” is, e.g. a small bit
of functionality written in English, without too much implementation language.
Ideally, Meesha and I will begin working with project teams to have a few user
stories prioritized, estimated and ready to go into a sprint.

* Handwriting our tasks on post-it notes has a nice feel to it. Developers took
their tasks back to their desks and stuck them on the wall for easy reference.
We’ll definitely get back to tracking in Jira at some point, but for now, going
old school feels right.

We’ve clearly _just_ started this experiment. We haven’t even completed a sprint
close yet, but will soon. Stay tuned...I’ll add another post to describe where
we end up.
