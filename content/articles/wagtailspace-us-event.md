This month, I attended and presented at the first [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io)
Space conference/sprint in the USA. Wagtail Space USA, led by the parent
company [Torchbox](https://torchbox.com), took place on June 14th–16th at the
Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. There were presentations by
Wagtail CMS developers and users, tutorial and lightning talks, and a sprint
throughout the three-day event.

[Wagtail](https://wagtail.io) is an open source content management system by
Torchbox, written in Python and built on the Django framework. We have been
experimenting with Wagtail CMS on the forthcoming CTL Portfolio, and are quite
pleased with the framework. Wagtail Space USA was an opportunity for us to see
what other groups are doing with the CMS, and meet to exchange ideas and share
experience. I presented the process the DevTeam went through that led us to
[choosing Wagtail CMS as one of the tools](/articles/choosing-wagtail/)
for us to use at the CTL. My talk was recorded and
[now up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiZScRcluCo).

There were over sixty attendees from tech companies, NGOs, universities, and
government agencies. This shows that Wagtail appeals to a wide base across
industries. Many switched to Wagtail because they were dissatisfied with
popular platforms like Drupal and WordPress. We seemed to share common reasons
why Wagtail is a much more viable alternative: it is flexible, configurable,
and has strong support in the open-source community.

The presentations were by representatives from a variety of industries. The
talks are now on YouTube, and here are my summaries of each:

* Tom Dyson, the Director at Torchbox, shared the history of Wagtail,
delivered the state of 
“[Wagtail in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICKYMO0YoFI),”
and the future directions the company will pursue for Wagtail given its growing
popularity. Some of the possibilities include improving the editorial workflow
and accessibility, and using machine learning services to support editors’
tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.
* Lacey Williams Henschel, a software engineer from REVSYS suggested ways to
improve and reorganize Wagtail documentation in her talk,
“[What the Wagtail Docs Don’t Tell You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCkxBNXWM64)”
* Using log messages can be beneficial for development of sites and application
using Wagtail. In his talk,
“[Django Logging for Wagtail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkztl9ORUKQ)”
Ryan Sullivan, a developer from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS),
University of Pennsylvania shared some examples on how logs were used to trace
block renderings, debug templatetags, and look at how and when methods were
being called.
* Lisa Adams and Codie Roelf from the
[Praekelt Foundation](https://www.praekelt.org)
(South Africa) shared how they used Wagtail to develop and scale mobile (with
multilingual support!) sites and applications across the globe,
“[Scaling Wagtail for 100 Million Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiOJAKE0M0I).”
Codie Roelf emphasized the FOSS nature of Wagtail in a different, but
important, perspective, _"When you contribute to Wagtail, you not only
contribute to the code base of a CMS, you contribute to the well-being of
millions of girls."_
* In his talk “[Wagtail in the Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1MeTEPRmJA),”
Daniele Procida of [Divio](https://www.divio.com) demonstrated how to quickly
launch a Wagtail site (front- and back-end) on [Divio’s Wagtail cloud](https://www.divio.com/wagtail).
Divio’s cloud platform is particularly useful for those who would like to
deploy and use Wagtail without going through the process of setting up and
deployment. Divio is also the company backing djangoCMS, another Django-based
framework.
* Ryan Verner’s company, StocksDigital, provides website and CMS solution for
newsrooms. His presentation,
“[Running a Multi-Site Newsroom in Wagtail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMCjInjAz-M),”
showed the challenges of fitting workflow, editing process, and content
versioning to unique newsrooms’ path that journalists follow—articles being
rapidly reviewed and edited in parallel, inline commenting, juxtaposition of
versions. Wagtail provided some relief, however, the incompatibilities still
exists. He also talked about using the CMS to streamline the delivery of news
articles via templates for different views (AMP, Apple News, etc).
* The [Freedom of Press Foundation](https://freedom.press) is
[using Wagtail to fight for press freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqbqsa04T8),
as presented by Harris Lapiroff. Lapiroff showcased interesting ways he used
Wagtail for the crowdfunding widgets, and for content management in other FPS
projects such as the
[U.S. Press Freedom Tracker](https://pressfreedomtracker.us).
* Python developer Michael Harrison talked about how he set up
[Wagtail as a headless CMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZT14u6WwdY)
for OpenStax at Rice University. My personal take: this is something very
awesome that I know very little about, so I let Wikipedia explain what
[headless CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_CMS) is.
* What type of Wagtail learner are you? Developer Dawn Wages explained the
different types of learning approaches using her fun species classification of
a beginner Wagtail-er,
“[Learning Wagtail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-tXt5fLj_s,).”
I might be the ”Scared-a-lot-o-don.”
* Government agencies are also using Wagtail. Andy Chosak from Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau talked about the benefits of open-source community
and contributions, and encourages some best practices to doing so:
“[Sharing is Caring: Contributing to the Wagtail Ecosystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AXyg6vvMTE).”

I also attended a Wagtail tutorial at the conference to learn anything that I
might have missed in my own experiment with the CMS. I finally figured out how
powerful [Streamfield](https://wagtail.io/features/streamfield/) can be, and
how free formatting of content in text can be a bad idea. But this is a topic
for another post. 

There was also a sprint session after the talks, for developers to code submit
their contribution to core Wagtail, and listed in
[Awesome Wagtail](https://github.com/springload/awesome-wagtail).
I certainly received good ideas and suggestions for improvement for my own use
of Wagtail in my CTL project. Collaboration is possible with strangers, when
the goal is for the good of free and open-source software.

[Lightning talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoxyBIpaXTU) given by
multiple developers took place after the sprint. It is interesting to hear how
people are using this CMS in social activism as well, and for causes that aim
to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.
