As we enter the new year, let’s look back at what we covered in _CompilED_ for
2019. We shared in our posts tips on JavaScript techniques and libraries that
we used in simulations and animations; and some interesting applications of
Vue, React, Django, and Cypress in our project development. We also focused on
project process, such as Design Thinking and the dynamics of project teamwork.
Accessibility is now a part of our project development process at the CTL, and
the redesign of _CompilED_ to meet web accessibility standards is aligned with
this commitment. As we enter the new decade, our team will continue sharing our
experimentation and knowledge in our media and software development, in
advancing the culture and innovation in teaching and learning.
