The year that was, with visually appealing, even pattern of 2-0-2-0, can be
summarized as tumultuous, weltschmerz, fatiguing, revealing, unprintable. That
year of the very bad trip confluence of Covid-19 pandemic, national and global
upheavals, challenged our understanding of our work, forced us to fortify our
focus, pushed us to examine our processes, and corralled our support for each
other—both professional and personal.

It was challenging, but we adapted to make progress in our work. As we leave
that year behind, here is a summary of what we covered in CompilED for 2020. We
shared some best practices in maintaining and monitoring our infrastructure.
The components and logistics of our development and design process also got
some revision, especially since our university transitioned to fully online
learning, and working remotely.

Hindsight is 2020, and we take with us the insights we gained in that
gobsmacking year into—what we dare hope will be—a twelvemonth of lesser bugs.
