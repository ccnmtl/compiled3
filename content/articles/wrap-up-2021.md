We end the year by looking back at what we covered in CompilED for 2021. This
year was still with its unique challenges of hybrid workspaces and learning
environments, but we’re proud of our work in instructional technologies at the
CTL.

Our team develops both software and media for the teaching and learning
community, so, we posted in CompilED three articles on the work in media
production. We shared what we learned in developing many of our software
projects, securing our infrastructure, and also touched upon the processes
involved in user stories and experience. 

And we’ll begin the new year year in resolution to continue our efforts in
advancing the culture and innovation in teaching and learning. Onward and
upward!
