The software development team at Columbia CTL is committed to making CompilED
content inclusive and accessible for everyone, including people with
disabilities.

## Conformance status

We are continually producing content on CompilED that meets the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
CompilED is partially conformant to WCAG 2.0 Level AA.

### Limitations

CompilED has been audited and evaluated with the assessment tools mentioned in
this statement. Some parts of the content do not fully conform to the WCAG 2.0
standards:

* Contrast ratios (link-to-text, text-to-background) for some elements are
lower than recommended values.
* Third-party content (external videos, embedded documents, images) used in
CompilED may not be fully accessible.
* Articles published prior to 2016 may not be fully compliant.

We will continue to work on fixing these issues.

## Assessment approach

We assessed and tested CompilED using the following tools. Nearly all of the
pages show minor to no violations of the accessibility standards.

* [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) web accessibility testing tool by 
[Deque Systems](https://www.deque.com)
* [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) web accessibility evaluation tool
by [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/)
* [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/), the screen
reader by Apple
* [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), an
open-source, automated auditor by [Google](https://www.google.com/accessibility/)
