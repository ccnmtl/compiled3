The software development team at Columbia CTL is committed to making CompilED
content inclusive and accessible for everyone, including people with
disabilities.

## Conformance status

We are continually producing content on CompilED that meets the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
CompilED is partially conformant to WCAG 2.0 Level AA.

### Limitations

CompilED has been audited and evaluated with the assessment tools mentioned in
this statement. Some parts of the content do not fully conform to the WCAG 2.0
standards:

* Third-party content (external videos, embedded documents, images) used in
CompilED may not be fully accessible.
* Articles published prior to 2016 may not be fully compliant.

## Assessment approach

We assessed and tested CompilED using the following accessibility scanners.
Nearly all of the pages show minor to no violations of the accessibility standards.
